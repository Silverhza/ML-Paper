% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

\begin{abstract}
In this project, we try to conquer the few-shot object detection problem by fine-tuning the last layer of some existing convolutional object detectors, e.g. Faster-RCNN. The prior methods usually encounter high variance problems which made them unreliable. However, we used an elegant sampling method so that the results are stable and the overfitting problem is diminished. We evaluated our approach on COCO and LVIS datasets, which shows that our method outperforms prior methods by 2 ~ 15 percent. Since this method does not propose a new architecture, the code is based on and modified from the detectron2 package, you can find the original code at ~\url{https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2}.

% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018, and modified by Alexandre Bouchard in
% 2019 and 2020. Previous contributors include Dan Roy, Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
