\section{Conclusion}
We proposed a simple two-stage fine-tuning approach for few-shot object detection.
Our method outperformed the previous meta-learning methods by a large margin on the current benchmarks.
In addition, we built more reliable benchmarks with revised evaluation protocols.
On the new benchmarks, our models achieved new states of the arts, and on the LVIS dataset our models improved the AP of rare classes by 4 points with negligible reduction of the AP of frequent classes.
