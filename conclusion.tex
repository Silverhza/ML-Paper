\section{Conclusion}
In this project, we use a two-stage fine-tuning method to conquer the object detection problem, which significantly outperforms prior methods and is shown to be statisticly stable with low variance. In addition, we compared the performance after fine-tuning with the performance before fine-tuning on base classes, and it turns out that the performance on base classes are hardly hurt. Therefore, our method become the state of the art object detection method so far.
